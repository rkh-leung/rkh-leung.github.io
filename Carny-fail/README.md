## Let's get going!

1. Before you start working through this challenge, make sure you have forked this repo to your own account.

2. Clone this repo from your GitHub to your computer.

3. Open the repo in VS Code and have a look around.

## The Games

These games are all independent from each other, however they are somewhat listed in order of difficulty, so try fixing them from top to bottom. 

[Inflate The Unicorn](./inflate-the-unicorn/inflate-the-unicorn-README.md)  
These poor unicorns have balloons for horns. Write code that inflates them!

[Whack-A-Mole](./whack-a-mole/whack-a-mole-README.md)  
The carnival classic "Whack a Mole" brought to life right inside your very own web browser. Where did all the moles go?

[Dress The Clown](./dress-the-clown/dress-the-clown-README.md)  
A dress-up game where you make a clown look fancy!
