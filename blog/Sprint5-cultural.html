            <h3>The end of the beginning Reflection</h3>
            <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>

            <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
            <p>
                Learning programming is an extremely challenging and demanding endevor.
            </p>
            <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
            <p>
                The flipped classroom style learning surprised me the most. I wasn't sure how I would adapt to a flipped learning environment because I've only encountered traditional learning prior to Dev Academy. Even though it was challenging to adapt to a new learning
                style & environment, I enjoyed it a lot.
            </p>
            <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
            <p>
                Every end of sprint reflection was challenging for me. Writing this blog and reflecting on values were things that I rarely do.
            </p>
            <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
            <p>
                I think the lack of emphasis on social skills is the main reason why success in traditional learning institutes doesn't translate to success in life. Web development encompasses a wide range of disciplines and it is inevitable to have to work with other
                people to complete projects.
            </p>
            <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
            </h2>
            <p>
                I don't think it is a waste of time at all. What's even more important than practicing programming is to develop the mindset that change is possible and continue to develop and improve my skill set even after the bootcamp.
