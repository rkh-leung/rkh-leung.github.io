            <p>
                My long term goal is to work as a machine learning engineer or anything related to the machine learning field.
            </p>
            <p>
                After becoming a proficient web developer, I'd like to branch out to other forms of development if the opportunity arise, in particular in the mobile side.

                Describe your own strengths and limitations
            </h2>
            <p>
                One of my strengths is accountability. I always hold myself to a higher standard because I believe in leading by example and I hope through my actions I can inspire and influence the people around me for the better.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my limitations is my learning strategy has been very inefficient or rather downright non-existent. I’ve been relying on my own understanding of a topic and raw brain power (which is rather limited according to research) to learn and remember things
                for far too long. It is unfortunate that I’ve built a lifetime of bad learning habits but I’m hoping going forward I’d be able to correct and eliminate as much of it as I possibly can.

                representatives.
            </h2>
            <p>
                I’ll devote more time and effort to learning the right way by making sure that I’ve done all the required and stretch exercises in order to get as much practice in as possible. And if I encountered a problem I couldn’t resolve on my own, I will practice
                the “programmer’s mindset” first before reaching out to my cohort/facilitator. </p>

                A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
            </h2>
            <p>
                I acknowledge and fully understand that, as a student with a non-tech background, my understanding of the course material would be slower than others and require more effort from my end to reach the same goal. As a result, I won’t be hesitant to reach
                out to my facilitator or cohort on slack as well as raise any concerns or difficulties I’m experiencing in the weekly 1-on-1 catch up with my facilitator.

            <p>
                While I don’t expect to be spoon-fed or hand-held through the learning process, I do expect guidance from my facilitator to lead me to a general direction that I should be heading toward should I encounter any roadblocks.
