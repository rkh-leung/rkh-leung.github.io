            <h2>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h2>
            <div class="nestedcontent">
                <div>
                    <p>
                        The structure of a website is just like any living beings! It has a skeletal structure, flesh and a central nervous system, a.k.a. the brain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Skeletal structure allows us to differentiate between different animals, say a dog from a cat. It is the fundamental characteristic that allows us to classify different species. Makeup language is the basic foundation that make up a website, while HTML
                        is the main markup language used to build a website, do keep in mind that it is not the only markup language in existence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Flesh is just like CSS; it beautifies the basic skeletal structure and brings it to life. CSS gives additional characteristics to a website, it has control over the entire design of a website from color scheme to font style to item placements, etcâ€¦
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly the brain connects both skeletal structure and flesh together to form cute furballs that we know and love.

            <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).</h2>

            <h2>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h2>
            <p>
                DOM stands for Document Object Model, it is a cross-platform standard for representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML and XML documents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although JavaScript is one of the most popular languages for manipulating DOM, DOM implementation can be built for any language.
            </p>
            <p>
                An example of JavaScript interacting with DOM is using <code>getElementsByClassName()</code> method. Thiw will return all objects with the same class identifier within a document, in this case, the title of the document
            </p>

            <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h2>
            <p>
                An array is a variable that stores a collection of items. It creates an ordered collections where items can be accessed by their numerical position in the list.
            </p>
            <p>
                An object is a variable that stores a collection of key-value pairs. The value of an object can be accessed by the key that's paired with the value.
            </p>
            <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h2>
            <p>
                A function is a piece of code that performs a specific task.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is useful because you can combine multiple functions to perform complex tasks, or use control flow statements to perform repetitive tasks.
