            <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
            <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h2>
            <p>
                There is this misconception that the brain doesn’t age very well; as we grow older, it becomes impossible to learn. The idiom “you can’t teach an old dog new tricks” stems from that belief. But research in neuroplasticity has shown that the brain <strong>can </strong>change
                even for adults.
            </p>
            <p>There are currently two main types of neuroplasticity:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Structural neuroplasticity, where the strength of the connections between neurons (or synapses) changes</li>
                <li>Functional neuroplasticity, where the permanent changes in synapses due to learning and development</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h2>
            <p>
                Knowing the brain can change is incredibly powerful because that means anyone can take ownership of their learning and improve their ability.
            </p>
            <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>intermittent fastening</li>
                <li>Travelling</li>
                <li>Exercise</li>
                <li>Mnemonic devices</li>
                <li>Musical instrument</li>
                <li>Non-dominant hand exercises</li>
                <li>Reading fiction</li>
                <li>Creating artwork</li>
                <li>Expand vocab/learn a different language</li>
                <li>Dancing</li>
                <li>Sleeping</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
            <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h2>
            <p>
                Growth mindset is the belief that abilities can be developed. It promotes resilience and exploration as well as placing emphasis on the journey rather than the outcome.
            </p>
            <h2>in this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
            <p>
                I’ve always been interested in learning and motivation and I came across a study on the way teachers encourage students can guide them into fixed or growth mindset. The results were mind-blowing because it demonstrated how powerful words can be and how
                easily our mind can be influenced.
            </p>
            <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
            <p>Placing more emphasis on the journey and less on the outcome.</p>
