                <h2>Got blocked on a simple problem</h2>
                <hr>
                <h2>What was the problem?</h2>
                <p>
                    Onclick function didn't work and I had no idea why.
                </p>
                <h2>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h2>
                <p>
                    I tried to debug it on my own with various techniques but still unable to solve the problem. After a day of tinkering, I decided to enlist the help of my peers.
                </p>
                <h2>How did you feel throughout the process?</h2>
                <p>It was frustrating because later I found out it was a pathing issue and had nothing to do with my code syntax.</p>
                <h2>What did you learn?</h2>
                <p>Two brains are better than one and it pays to go over the code with a fine tooth comb.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
                <h2>Solved a problem in an elegant way</h2>
                <hr>
                <h2>What was the problem?</h2>
                <p>
                    The coding kata remove buzz word challenge. I used a regular express to remove the buzz word but it didn't remove all the buzzes.
                </p>
                <h2>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h2>
                <p>I enlisted the brilliant minds from Dev Academy code-help-desk channel.</p>
                <h2>How did you feel throughout the process?</h2>
                <p>Troubled, because it works except that one instance and I couldn't figure out why.</p>
                <h2>What did you learn?</h2>
                <p>Reading my own code with a fresh mind instead of being frustrated with a preconceived notion about why it should work.</p>
